# Section 4.2 - Fault Tolerance

## Redundancy

**Redundancy** is the inclusion of extra components that can be used to mitigate failure of a system if other components fail.

- You might think of substitute teachers as a redundancy in schools to make sure that if a teacher “fails” (i.e. can’t come to school), there will still be a teacher there for the students.

One way to accomplish network redundancy is by having more than one path between any two connected devices.

- With two paths, if one path breaks or is otherwise unavailable, we have another way to still make a connection.

If a particular device or connection on the Internet fails, subsequent data will be sent via a different route, if possible.

- The protocols we talked about last class are built to expect these issues to come up and choose a new path to send information through.

## Fault-Tolerance

When a system can support failures and still continue to function, it is called **fault-tolerant**. This is important because elements of complex systems fail at unexpected times, often in groups, and fault tolerance allows users to continue to use the network.

- The Internet has been engineered to be fault-tolerant, with abstractions for routing and transmitting data.

Redundancy within a system often requires additional resources but can provide the benefit of fault tolerance.

- To have two ways to connect to things, we need more physical connections, but it gives us leeway if one breaks.

The redundancy of routing options between two points increases the reliability of the Internet and helps it scale to more devices and more people.

## Work

Think about the Web activity we did with string today in class. In your own words, why is this an analogy for the redundancy and fault-tolerance of the Internet? Minimum 3 sentences.

-

Choose one of the following sources to learn from about the Internet. After going through the source, write 3 sentences about what you thought was interesting about it.

Sample Response:

[Crash Course Computer Science - Data Compression](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtDxDvCpPL4) - I thought it was interesting how you combine three primary colors in proportions to create other colors. The fact that you don't need to save every single pixel's color to recreate an image with a lot of accuracy seems counterintuitive. Comparing frames of videos seems like an intuitive way to determine what information is redundant in a video.
