# Section 4.3 - Parallel and Distributed Computing

## Computing Vocabulary

**Sequential computing** is a computational model in which operations are performed in order one at a time.

- When you do math as a human being, it is sequential computing, as you can only do one calculation at a time.

**Parallel computing** is a computational model where the program is broken into multiple smaller sequential computing operations, some of which are performed simultaneously.

- This is often called “threading” where a computer will use multiple of its brains (which are called threads) to each do calculations without being slowed down by the other threads.

**Distributed computing** is a computational model in which multiple devices are used to run a program.

- This we don’t see as often, but can be incredibly powerful when you need a lot of computational power, more than one computer on its own could provide.

## Sequential Efficiency

Comparing efficiency of solutions can be done by comparing the time it takes them to perform the same task.

- If it takes a computer 10 minutes to complete with one program, and the same computer 5 minutes to complete with a different program, then the 5 minute program is more efficient than the 10 minute program.

A sequential solution takes as long as the sum of all of its steps.

- If one step is slow, it slows the whole solution!

## Parallel Efficiency

A parallel computing solution takes as long as its sequential tasks plus the longest of its parallel tasks.

Parallel computing consists of a parallel portion and a sequential portion.

- Not everything can be done in parallel, so even parallel solutions use some sequential tasks.

The "speedup" of a parallel solution is measured in the time it took to complete the task sequentially, divided by the time it took to complete the task when done in parallel.

- This is a classic measure of efficiency, this would calculate how many times longer it takes to do it sequentially as opposed to in parallel. With our example from earlier, 10 / 5 = 2, so it takes the sequential 2 times as long, or we would say “the parallel solution is 2 times faster”.

Solutions that use parallel computing can scale more effectively than solutions that use sequential computing.

- If I had to calculate the average of 10 classes of grades, I could have the computer split the task up to 10 threads to do them all at once. When I have to do it for 20 classes, I could split it up to 20 threads or have each thread do 2 and still use 10. This is more scalable than sequential where you do each class one at a time.

When increasing the use of parallel computing in a solution, the efficiency of the solution is still limited by the sequential portion. This means that at some point, adding parallel portions will no longer meaningfully increase the efficiency.

- If I want to calculate the average grade for each of 10 classes, and then pick out the maximum one, then the average calculations could be parallel but the maximum has to be sequential at the end. If it takes a long time to find the maximum, then being able to better divide the 20 class averages in parallel doesn’t make the efficiency much better, since we are still slowed by the final maximum calculation.

## Distributed Efficiency

Distributed computing allows problems to be solved that could not be solved on a single computer because of either the processing time or storage needs involved.

Distributed computing allows much larger problems to be solved quicker than they could be solved using a single computer.

- Two great examples of this are the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search (GIMPS) and Folding @ Home

## Work

Consider the following examples of parallel computing. Identify what aspects are actually in parallel, and which are sequential:

I want to calculate the GPA of every student in the school based on all of the classes they've taken and then find the average GPA in the school. I can calculate the GPA of multiple students at a time and then at the end calculate the average GPA of all of them. -

I want to find prime numbers in a large list. I can check multiple numbers at a time, but each number I want to check requires an intensive factoring process (figuring out what numbers can cleanly divide it). -

Browse through the [Folding @ Home Website](https://foldingathome.org/?lng=en) to learn more about the project. In your own words, how is it an example of distributed computing and why is it useful for this to be done with distributed computing? 3 sentences minimum. -
